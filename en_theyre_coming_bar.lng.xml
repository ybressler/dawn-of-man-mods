	<string name="invasion_1_main_title">They're coming.</string>
	<string name="invasion_1_main_description">Dead raiders surround your settlement.
Your war chief bends down for a closer look at their war paint. His face twists into one of horror.

	<string name="invasion_2_main_title">A dark omen.</string>
	<string name="invasion_2_main_description">A commotion in the village!
One of the village elders falls to his knees in desperate prayer.
The crowd parts, and forms an open circle around Timmy (an adorable child). A large "X" is painted on his forehead in wolf-blood.
"I've seen enough!" growls your war chief before storming out.
"Does this mean... Are they coming?" someone asks.
"No," replies the elder solemnly.
"They're already here."</string>

	<!-- Merit driven invasions -->

	<string name="fortifications_warning_title">Neolithic unlocked!</string>
	<string name="fortifications_warning_description">You've unlocked the power to harness the earth. Be careful while building fortifications.
Such an outright display of strength is sure to anger your enemies...
Tip: Build walls and a gate, but don't build towers or defensive platforms until you're ready to defend against the tide of invaders who'll storm your fortress driven by jealosy, bloodlust, and sacrificial zeal.
</string>

<!-- Challenge the Uhrghor clan (1 watchtower)-->
	<string name="fortifications_unlocked_title">Fortifications unlocked!</string>
	<string name="fortifications_unlocked_description">
Rumor has it that your settlement has unlocked a strange new technology which can "shoot arrows from the sky."
The rival clan of Uhrghor is paying close attention.
Tip: Wait until your population is greater than 65 before building any towers.
</string>

	<string name="fortifications_build_title">Watch Towers Built!</string>
	<string name="fortifications_build_description">
How dare you mock the strength of the Uhrghors!
An elite warrior band marches to your settlement to prove man is mightier than fixtures of wood and dirt.

	<string name="post_fortifications_build_description">Your victory against the Uhrghors has spread near and far!

<string name="fortifications_build_6_description">
Be wary, for your display of outright strength has taunted the all-powerful Gahrghor Clan.
They gather in the far plains of the East, bidding their time.
In the meantime, no one wants to join your settlement out of sheer terror. Don't expect any migration until the Gahrghors are dealt with.
Tip: If you build 12 towers, the Gahrghors will invade in massive numbers. (Have a population > 125)
</string>


<string name="fortifications_build_12_title">The Gahrghor Clan Moves</string>
<string name="fortifications_build_12_description">
For 50 migrations of the buffalo, the Gahrghor Clan has ruled in the far off plains of the East.
But lately, clouds the size of mountains can be seen coming from the East. It's the Gahrghors! They're on the move.
It must of been your arrogant towers which has beckoned their wrath. And now, you must pay.
</string>

<string name="post_fortifications_build_12_title">Ghargors Defeated!</string>
<string name="post_fortifications_build_12_description">
Your battlement's walls are decorated with the slain bodies of your enemies. Most impressive of all, Chieftan Ourga's head sits upon a spike at your fortress' entrance.
Truly, you have shown your strength. Expect increased migrations while all the neighboring settlements hear of your astonishing victory.
